title: "How to Find Success: Choose a Yearly Theme"
---

Every year, I choose a theme to focus my decisions on a specific target. So far, it has worked rather well.

The year of 2018 is all about expansion for me. This is all inclusive of my mind, body, and business.

In the last few years, I’ve reached basic proficiency in a second language, built my freelancing business up to a reasonable level while maintaining a lifestyle I love overseas, and made casual trips through Europe at my leisure. The themes through these years were _Self Awakening_ and _Thriving_.

Over the next year, I will create sustainable habits that benefit not only myself, but everyone I know and love and those who follow my work. I will see abundance in personal fulfillment and financial gain as a result.

I will achieve this through mindfulness.

Tracking my habits, moods, activities, and how they align with my goals will play a key role in achieving this goal. I will plot my journey here at this blog.

Forming rituals and habits has been the biggest blockade between me and large-scale success. I am sure the exact course will change over the year, but one thing is for certain: I will be more persistent than ever this year.
