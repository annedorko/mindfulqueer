title: Controlling Time
---

Time is one asset we all have exactly the same amount of.

No matter where you’re starting from, we can all get better at the way we use our time.

For me, I am choosing to experiment with the theory that prioritizing mindfulness over everything else every day will help me make better use of the rest of my time.

Why? 

Because I am so easily distracted and caught up in things.

When you lose track of what you want, you lose the way to gaining it. Whatever that is.

Mindfulness practices – such as daily meditation, affirmations, and journals – all help me to stay mindful of what my actual goals are.

Usually, when I have a clear goal, I am pretty damned good at making it happen. Therefore, it adds up that mindfulness may end up being the most powerful practice I can spend intentional time on. It should help me not only gain clearer focus, but retain that focus over a sustained period of time. This kind of sustained focus is my notorious shortcoming. 

Expansion. Expanding the limits of my mind and body. Expanding my empire. 

Re-examining what that means every day and identifying how I can take yet another step towards the end goal. Every. Single. Day.

> I can control the way I spend my time.

I can’t wait to be checking back in around days 90, 180, and 365... just to see how far I’ve come.
