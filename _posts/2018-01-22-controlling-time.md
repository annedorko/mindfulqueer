title: Controlling Time
---

Time is one asset we all have exactly the same amount of.*

No matter where youâ€™re starting from, we can all get better at the way we use our time.

For me, I am choosing to experiment with the theory that prioritizing mindfulness over everything else every day will help me make better use of the rest of my time.

Why? 

Because I am so easily distracted and caught up in things.

When you lose track of what you want, you lose the way to gaining it. Whatever that is.

Mindfulness practices â€“ such as daily meditation, affirmations, and journals â€“ all help me to stay mindful of what my actual goals are.

Usually, when I have a clear goal, I am pretty damned good at making it happen. Therefore, it adds up that mindfulness may end up being the most powerful practice I can spend intentional time on. It should help me not only gain clearer focus, but retain that focus over a sustained period of time. This kind of sustained focus is my notorious shortcoming. 

Expansion. Expanding the limits of my mind and body. Expanding my empire. 

Re-examining what that means every day and identifying how I can take yet another step towards the end goal. Every. Single. Day.

> I can control the way I spend my time.

I canâ€™t wait to be checking back in around days 90, 180, and 365... just to see how far Iâ€™ve come.
