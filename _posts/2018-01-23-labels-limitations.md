I am unlimited.

Today a hearty discussion of gender and marketing businesses came up on my newsfeed.

I am unlimited.

In my life, I have curated groups of amazing individuals. Mostly they are queer, gender nonconforming, or otherwise do not follow so-called traditional expectation society places on us since a disturbingly young age.

I am unlimited.

So I forget sometimes about the messaging ingrained so deeply in the “real” world, because I have been fortunate to create a space where I am accepted as-is. (My existence truly must be fake to the outside world.) I forget about the boxes placed on people. The expectations. The fact there is something terribly freakish and wrong with those boxes and expectations. How they have created a destructive vortex of power imbalance and lack of responsibility for those who have the upper hand.

I am unlimited.

It can feel like a punch to the face when I step back into these conversations, where people don’t understand the harmful dynamics of gender. It’s a terribly ignorant way to be, especially considering how many gender nonconforming folks have been at the [forefront of the civil and women’s rights movements](https://www.advocate.com/advocate50/2017/5/01/these-trans-revolutionaires-are-unforgettable). 

On mornings like these I have to work hard to remember and internalize this fact:

> I am unlimited in what I can achieve.

**Yes.** I am unlimited. I am unlimited. I am unlimited.
