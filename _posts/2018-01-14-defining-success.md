title: To Reach Success You Must Define Success
---

I believe that success is relative. Whether you are successful depends on what you set out to do in the first place. While I [fail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFf6rhcYkXw) at many individual tasks, I am a greatly successful person on the whole.

Before moving into the year of Expansion, it’s important for me to define what that means. 

## Expansion Means: Stop Limiting Myself

The underlying theme I am referring to with the word ‘expansion’ is to stop limiting myself. In other words, stop letting my hang ups define what I am capable of achieving. 

_I feel stupid when I meditate._

Doesn’t matter. I know it will serve me well to meditate so I’m going to do it.

_I get discouraged easily when starting a new habit._

Doesn’t matter. I am going to persistently start my routines over and over again I find a version that sticks.

_My brain shuts down when I get overwhelmed or anxious._

Doesn’t matter. I am going to open the floodgates and swim because it’s the only way I know to reach everything I’ve ever dreamed of.

**I am doing what nobody else will do to find success.** I am showing up and putting in the work even if I failed spectacularly at it the day before.

## Specific Goals for 2018

Expansion is the theme directing my everyday decisions this year.

However, I also believe in setting SMART goals on top of general ones. SMART stands for: 

- Specific
- Measurable
- Attainable
- Realistic
- Time-related

Here are a few of my more specific goals for 2018, which will help me break down my daily, weekly, and monthly activities into direct actions that bring me closer to true expansion.

1. Financial: Stop freelancing entirely. (Ideal: Earn 10k gross in one month as a business owner.)
2. Strength: Conquer basic bodyweight exercises. (Ideal: 10 regular push ups.)
3. Health: Regularly eat a filling breakfast without added sugars. (Ideal: One cheat breakfast/morning per week at most.)
4. Mental: Complete daily affirmations and journaling. (Ideal: Regular daily routine without breaks.)
5. Spiritual: Regular meditation. (Ideal: Regular daily routine without breaks.)

These are the areas of my life currently lacking. Laying a strong foundation here can only enhance the parts of my life I do well focusing on. With these goals, I can take small steps throughout the year that bring me closer to the desired end result. As the year progresses, I will reevaluate my progress and decide what each next best _specific_ step will be.
