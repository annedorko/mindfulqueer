title: "Perfection is the Enemy – Full Stop"
---

If 2018 is my year of expansion, everything I do this year should take me one small step closer towards expanding my limits. To that end, when I pick an affirmation in the morning, I try to think about what has been holding me back over the past few days.

It started off with me feeling overwhelmed by the sheer amount of work that lies ahead of me to reach my goals. So, I stuck with: 

> I am not doing everything today. I am taking one small step.

That helped me tremendously to shape my days into tasks I could handle. However, this morning as I reflected, I realized I was still getting hung up on something.

The something turns out to be a few specific, increasingly urgent tasks that I have been afraid to do because I know I don’t have the time or resources to make as amazing as I see them in my head. 

Thing is, nobody but me expects me to reach the vision I’m seeing. They just want something effective and functional.

Yet, here I am, pysching myself out about even starting because I’m afraid to fall short of my own expectations. I do this so often, it’s becoming a real concern. The sheer number of times I avoid something altogether because I probably won’t meet my own unrealistic standards. 

(I blame this phenomenon for why I have yet to build my empire.)

As I thought on these things this morning after meditation, I realized I needed an anti-perfectionist affirmation. I ended up choosing two. The first is because I believe it is powerful to make “I” statements. The second is because I have a lot of work to do and I need to let go of it being perfect when it’s finished.

> I am not perfect, but I am powerful.
> 
> It doesn’t have to be perfect to be effective.

Do you ever put something off because you’re afraid you won’t fulfill your own expectations? 

I encourage you to dwell on this seriously. I have limited myself in so many ways due to this kind of thinking. It’s a habit I need to be especially aware of and break as soon as possible.
