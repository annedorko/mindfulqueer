title: Affirmations in Foreign Languages
---

Many small actions lead to something much larger. That is the foundation of habit building for a better life. It is why, even though my new formed habits haven’t been perfect, I will continue to work on them. 

I will not give up. Every single I time I successfully do it is a small rewiring of my brain. The more of those actions I make, the more successful I will continue to be in future attempts. 

Right now, I am exploring my Hungarian heritage again. Specifically, I want to learn the lanuage. To incorporate it into my newly forming routines, I have decided to find a few affirmations that I can repeat in Hungarian instead of only English. This way, I figure I learn to think _positively_ in the new language I’m picking up, even before I fully understand it. 

> Sok kicsi sokra megy.

This is a saying in Hungarian to mean many small things add up to something greater.

I am not sure whether affirmations in another language will work the same way. However, I know its meaning and I dwell on it (in English) while I practice my pronunciation of the phrase out loud over and over again. 

Do you think practicing a new language as a part of your affirmations is a good idea?
