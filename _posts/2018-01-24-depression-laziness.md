title: Depression or Laziness?
---

I have developed so many powerful mechanisms for combatting depression that sometimes, I forget it’s a thing in my life anymore.

Depression is, and always has been, a side-effect of my more severe anxiety. To be sure, I _also_ have developed plenty of habits to work with, around, and through my anxiety, but it crops up way more often than depression does.

As an aside... This morning I woke up from a dream about catastrophe which was only escapable by plane, but then we were running late for the plane. Go figure. It’s the kind of dream you forget specifics about, but the icky feelings linger throughout the day.

Regardless. One of my biggest fears is having and seeing the solution for a goal I have, but ultimately not following through it. 

It goes back to the anxiety cycle I’ve talked about before. I put something off, which makes me feel like a failure, so I avoid thinking about it or touching it or working on it. You know, the things that would help it not be a failure. As you can see, this quickly leads to endless procrastination and an abandoned or failed project.

The whole thing is a very self-fulfilling fear.

I’ve been trying to internalize a few beliefs to help combat this cycle. Today’s affirmations is one of them: 

> Success and money come easily to me.

Even after repeating this for 5 minutes straight this morning, I know I have a ways to go. My default expectation is failure.

On the other hand, the road to success _is_ lined with failure. The problem is that, so is the road to failure. I have to move past the idea that the only thing I’ll ever really have is failure. 

I encourage myself and others to think more positively about daily successes on Twitter. To review moments to be proud of. To consider, “What good have I done today?”

Depression sometimes strikes when I least expect, in insidious ways. I can tell because I lose interest in even the stuff I normally really care about. My overall motivation drops to subzero, even for that which I enjoy most. On these days I need to be kinder to myself about not hitting all of my missions. Focus on going through the motions for a few small wins. Acknowledge I did good. Move on. 

I am hoping  continued mindfulness will help me stay aware of these days and continue to follow a routine that cycles me through my small swings of depression. In other words, developing a method for staying afloat and moving out of the rip tide by swimming to the side rather than fighting against the current. But also, not reading too much into off days and attributing laziness to depression when it’s not warranted.

Here’s to the ever-raging internal battle of self!
