title: The Cycle of Anxiety
---

Severe anxiety has plagued me as long as I can remember.

I tend to cope by ‘flooding’ myself with so much responsibility that I effectively trigger my brain into fight or flight mode. It works for me because in my case, the response is usually fight mode. I go full beast and work 12 hour days most of the time. This focus distracts me from the nagging anxiety because I never have time to address it.

Unfortunately, I inevitably sign myself up for so much that one thing or the other falls to the wayside. Eventually, I burn out. II think it happens about every 2-3 months or so. (Note: These mindfulness practices are my game plan to create a sustainable solution to address this.)

So, I stop to breathe when burnout comes. 

This gives the anxiety a foothold. It takes over and spins me into a series of self-doubt that freezes me into place.

Sleep becomes a moot point. My communication fails; I stop reaching out, full radio silence. Projects I care about deeply fall to the wayside. My fear of bringing attention to my situation causes me to find solace in mind numbing activities. I struggle to differentiate between self-care and distraction, healthy habits and procrastination. While this isn’t great for relationships, this kind of behavior is terrible for someone who is self-employed, whose clients are relying on them to come through on work.

It makes me feel unreliable, unworthy, incapable. Then I believe these things, and I act accordingly, which makes them true.

The solution is simple: Show up. Speak up. Do the work. It _really_ isn’t complicated.

Yet, simple isn’t always easy.

The brain is a powerful thing.

Thankfully, my anxiety is no longer paired with the hormones of puberty. Those were some rough times, indeed. However, my angst and seething self-hatred turns into a much quieter acceptance that I will always be broken.

The thing is, I am not unreliable, unworthy, or incapable on the whole. I am powerful. I am a force of nature. On those bad days, in those short spurts, I don’t function so well. That is undeniable. However, my value and worth is not measured by my off days. 

Anxiety is my biggest enemy.

It gives me self-doubt. It skews my perspective. It reinforces every bad thought I’ve ever had about myself. It rewards poor performance with self-fulfilling prophecies of doom by scratching its itch of needing to be proven right.

I am not my anxiety. My anxiety is simply a passenger on this journey. 

Accepting anxiety as a permanent fixture in my life has been my greatest strength. Now, I can focus on wielding anxiety to my advantage wherever possible, and figure out ways to downplay its negative elements.

I am able to size up anxiety for what it is – a mind game – rather than allow it to sit invisibly on my shoulder influencing my life without my consent.

The tides of my anxiety will rise and fall. Some days will be much worse than others. With every cycle, I can learn more about its patterns and devise new ways to minimize the devastation it causes.

When it comes to personal goals, expanding my life in 2018 is all about unlearning what anxiety has convinced me is true: That I am bad at doing good things for myself, that I am incapable of following through on long-term positive decisions. Which is why this year will be the first time I successly create healthy habits for my mind, body, and soul. Anxiety isn’t calling the shots this time, I am.

Bring it on.
