title: Small Steps, or Stuck?
---

On some days, it feels like the small steps are getting you nowhere. In fact, you feel like sometimes you’ve slid backwards.

It’s especially hard on those days to feel like it’s worth it to keep taking small steps. 

Here’s the thing: it is _always_ worth it. Every time. 

I keep drilling that into my head. It’s so hard to hold onto when your brain feels like it’s drowning.

It’s worth it to keep taking those small steps. It’s hard to see your progress when you’re in the middle of the grind. But I promise but you and myself, you are getting somewhere. You’ll see soon enough. And you will be so happy you stuck with it.
