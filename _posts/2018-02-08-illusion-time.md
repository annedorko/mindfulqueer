title: Illusion of Time

Time is such a strange thing. The way we treat it in our daily lives, the stress it gives us.

The minutes often drag on by so slowly, but then we blink and suddenly a year is gone. Where does the time go? We all get 24 hours in a day. Sure, some of us have more days than others. Yet, it seems like some of us have so much more time in a day than others as we move through life.

I’m not sure how to make the most of my time. I am still seeking the balance of being here, present, in the moment and being at peace while also working towards some kind of future goals.

I am so easily overwhelmed by time. The simple raw power floors me.

Today I actually woke up and got out of bed before 9am. I know that today is going to feel much longer than every other day this year because of it. Will practicing my awareness and mindfulness so early in the morning finally bring me the focus and clarity I’ve been seeking? Well, that’s been my goal this whole time. Let’s hope so.
