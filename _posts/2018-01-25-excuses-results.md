title: Results or Excuses
---

I’m learning how to sell stuff. It’s really not that complicated. The steps are simple.

Of course, as I well know... simple does not mean easy.

At the end of the day, we have results or excuses. That’s all there is to it.

So often, we know _exactly_ what we need to do to fix a problem or reach a goal. Most things in life are way less complicated than we try to make them. (Not everything obviously, but a LOT more than we like to admit.)

I’m not in shape and over a healthy weight range. The answer is to eat at a calorie deficit (simple) and do minimal 30~ minutes of exercise a day (simple). I have the time and ability to do both. Yet I could talk up a whirlwind of reasonable sounding explanations about why that is something I’ve never consistently done.

I’m not in tune with my emotional wellbeing. The answer is to meditate (simple), do daily affirmations (simple), and journal every day (simple). Yet until recently, I would wax on about how stupid I feel when committing to any of these tasks.

I’m mostly freelancing instead of running the online business I’d like to have. The answer is to outreach to several influencers each day (simple), engage with my existing audience a few times a week (simple), and write a few hundred words per day (simple). Yet I could explain to you why this is all way more difficult than that, and whine all about how these things are quite impossible to do (they’re really not). 

I could go on with more examples, but you get the idea. 

My own mind is the entire reason I don’t succeed. I get overwhelmed, anxious, stressed, nervous, or overthink all of it and end up shutting down entirely.

I am tired of having excuses instead of results. I’ve gotten a ton of amazing results in my life and none of it came from the excuses, it all came from action. Imagine what I could do if by the end of each day I was mostly sitting on results? I’ve come this far on mostly excuses and some small results. My future is unlimited, truly, once I stop making excuses.

The trick is to be honest with myself and stop blocking myself in my head before I even have the chance to act.

What unnecessary excuses are you making?
