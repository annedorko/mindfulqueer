title: Inside a First Attempt at Verbally Performing Affirmations
---

I stare in the direction of the window, not really at the window or even through it. I ground my feet on the floor, sat comfortably straight, hands in my lap.

I am anxious and overwhelmed right now with the sheer amount of work ahead of me, so I’ve chosen this affirmation for the day:

> I am not doing everything today, but taking one small step.

Nobody is home right now, which is good because I feel self conscious. I say it out loud.

_I am not doing everything today, but taking one small step._

It doesn’t roll off the tongue quite as comfortably as I thought. It comes out with a bit of trepidation. I try it again. 

_I am not doing everything today, but taking one small step._

Still awkward. I tweak it.

_I am not doing everything today. I am taking one small step._

That feels better. Two powerful statements. My voice strengthens. As I continue to repeat it in a level tone, I find myself leaning forward and placing my hands on the table in front of me. Almost as if I am attempting to convince the invisible reflection of myself sitting across from me.

**_I am not doing everything today. I am taking one small step._**

I repeat this statement for a little while until it feels natural. This is today’s mantra. 

> I am not doing everything today. 

Rome was not built in a day. Legacies are built over a lifetime. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

> I am taking one small step. 

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. There is a long way to achieving my dreams and the only way to get further is to take the next best step at a time, even when it feels futile compared to the overall distance.

The more I repeat it, the deeper I think about how important it is to accept this way of existing in my anxiety ridden life. I am constantly torn apart but what I’m not doing, rather than focusing on what actions I can take right now because it feels pointless. Yet, everything worthwhile that I have accomplished was not done in a day. I have proof that one day at a time works, each day leading closer to the end goal. The faster I learn to embrace that mentality, the more control I gain over my presence of mind. When I am centered in my mind, I feel more content and put out my best work.

I’d like to repeat similar affirmation sessions once or twice more using this mantra throughout the day. Let’s see how it goes.
